# Machinery â€” A Systems Management Toolkit for Linux

## SYNOPSIS

`machinery` SUBCOMMAND \[options\] <br>
`machinery` help [SUBCOMMAND]


## DESCRIPTION

Machinery is a systems management toolkit for Linux. It supports configuration
discovery, system validation, and service migration. Machinery's core concept
is the complete representation of a system by a universal system description.
System descriptions are managed independently of the described systems which
allows for system state conservation and offline preparation of modifications.

Machinery has a set of commands which work with this system description.
These commands can be combined to form work flows. Machinery is targeted at the
system administrator of the data center.

More information about `machinery` and its usage can be found at
http://machinery-project.org or in the documentation which can be opened using
`machinery man --html`.
