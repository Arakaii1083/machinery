## build â€” Build Image from System Description

### SYNOPSIS

`machinery build` NAME -i IMAGE-DIR | --image-dir=IMAGE-DIR

`machinery` help build


### DESCRIPTION

The `build` command builds an image from a system description. The image is a
system image in the qcow2 format, which can be used with the KVM hypervisor.
It can be run locally or deployed to a cloud environment.

`machinery` uses the image building command line tool
[KIWI](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI) to perform the actual build. KIWI
data is stored to a temporary directory and cleaned up after the build. The KIWI
log is shown as output of the `build` command format for showing progress and
diagnosing errors.

When building an image, Machinery filters out some files which would break the
built image. The list of filters is shown at the beginning of the build.


### ARGUMENTS

### PREREQUISITES

  * The `build` command requires the packages `kiwi` and `kiwi-desc-vmbxoot`.

    build machine on which `machinery build` is called.
