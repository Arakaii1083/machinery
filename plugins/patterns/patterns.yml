:name: Patterns
:initials: pt
:description: |
  Contains all patterns or tasks installed on the inspected system. A pattern is a
  collection of software packages, similar to the idea of tasks on Debian/Ubuntu-
  like systems.
  The meaning of software patterns depends on the package manager of the
  distribution. Therefore, the pattern scope on SUSE based systems uses the
  `zypper` command to obtain the information about installed pattern names, whereas
  on Debian based systems the `tasksel` tool is necessary to list installed tasks.
