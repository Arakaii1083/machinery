A list\nof the available scopes and information about what they do can be found\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nUsers of Machinery who inspect systems need to be aware of the security implications in order\nto take the right decisions on how to protect the retrieved data.\n\n\nRetrieval of Data\n\n\nMachinery transfers data from one end point to another via SSH (using public key authentication).\n\n\nDepending on the scope, Machinery \ncollects information\n\nabout files on the system. Additionally, when the \n--extract-files\n option is given for the\n\ninspect\n command, not only the meta data about the files (e.g. permission bits, owner, group etc\n.) but also the file content is extracted. Machinery does not distinguish between sensitive\ndata (such as private keys or password files). That means that everyone with access to the system\ndescription has automatically access to \nall\n extracted files and contained sensitive data.\n\n\nroot/sudo Privileges\n\n\nAn inspection can only be done, when the user on the inspected system is either root or has\nsudo privileges. Information about the required sudo configuration can be found\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nStorage of Data\n\n\nAccess Restrictions\n\n\nAfter an inspection has been completed, the directory where the description is stored is made\nreadable only for the user. The data is not encrypted by Machinery.\n\n\nUsed Permission Bits\n\n\nWhen Machinery extracts data, it sets permission bits for files and directories as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermission Bits\n\n\nUsed for ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0700\n\n\n... directories inside the description directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0600\n\n\n... for files inside the description directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing System Descriptions\n\n\nBy default, all system descriptions are stored in the directory \n.machinery\n in the home directory\nof the user running Machinery. The directory can be redefined by the environment variable\n\n$MACHINERY_DIR\n. Each description has its own subdirectory. There is a \nmanifest.json\n file in\neach description directory which contains the data of the inspection. Extracted files are stored in\nseparate subdirectories inside the same description directory.\n\n\nPresentation of Data\n\n\nThere are several ways how data can be presented to one or more users. The user has the option to\neither start a web server and view descriptions or view the descriptions only in the console.\n\n\nThe following commands are used to present data to users:\n\n\n\n\nshow\n\n\ncompare\n\n\nserve\n\n\nlist\n\n\n\n\nAll of the commands listed above also have a \n--html\n option. When this option is used, Machinery\nstarts a web server what will listen on the IP address \n127.0.0.1\n. The \nserve\n command\noffers also a \n--public\n option which makes the server listen on all configured IP addresses.\n\n\nWARNING:\n When making the server reachable from the outside, users can modify the link to\naccess also other descriptions. There is currently no way to restrict the access to only one\ndescription.\n\n\nThe \nserve\n command also allows the user to specify a port via the \n--port\n option. When no port\nis specified, the default port which is configured in the machinery config file in\n\n~/.machinery/machinery.config\n) will be taken.\n\n\nExport of Data\n\n\nexport-autoyast\n\n\nThe \nexport-autoyast\n command creates an AutoYaST profile for an automated installation. The result\nare also tar balls containing the extracted files from the system description. These files\npotentially contain sensitive data (e.g. passwords). This fact needs to be kept in mind, especially\nif these files are copied to a web server for an AutoYaST installation via HTTP.\n\n\nexport-kiwi\n\n\nThe program Kiwi allows you to build OS images what you can use for installation. Machinery gives\nyou the opportunity to build a complete Kiwi configuration from a system description. This\nconfiguration can be used to build an image via Kiwi. The \nexport-kiwi\n command creates a\ndirectory, where it stores the Kiwi configuration and the files of a system description. These\nfiles potentially contain sensitive data (e.g. passwords).\n\n\nbuild\n\n\nThe created image potentially contains sensitive data (e.g. passwords) from extracted files.\n\n\ndeploy\n\n\nThe uploaded image potentially contains sensitive data (e.g. passwords) from extracted files.",
