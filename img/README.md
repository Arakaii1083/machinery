This directory contains icons for the scopes. The source file is the SVG file
`scope-logos.svg`. The PNG versions are generated from this.

To add a new icon, open the SVG in Inkscape, copy and modify an existing icon
and export two PNG versions, the big one with 50x50 pixels and the small one
with 25x25 pixels. Follow the naming scheme of the existing files.
